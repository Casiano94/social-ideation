Social Ideation
===============
Social Ideation is an application that connects one of today's leading online idea management platforms, [IdeaScale]
(http://www.ideascale.com), with the largest virtual space of participation and socialization, [Facebook]
(http://www.Facebook.com), allowing people to contribute to IdeaScale crowdsourcing ideation initiatives 
directly from Facebook. 

It is a concrete effort toward bringing internet-mediated civic participation tools, such as IdeaScale, closer to the 
large and diverse community of Facebook users. Apart from reaching wider and larger sources of information, it aims at 
reducing as much as possible the participation barrier, enabling people to take part on crowdsourcing ideation processes 
by using only Facebook elements, namely facebook pages, hashtags, posts, comments, and likes.

Mapping Model
-------------

Social Ideation proposes the following model to map IdeaScale initiatives with the Facebook elements.
